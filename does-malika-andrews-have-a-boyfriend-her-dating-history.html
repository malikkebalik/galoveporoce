To date, the 27-year-old ESPN reporter has made history as the first woman to host the NBA draft and the youngest sideline reporter to debut during the 2020 NBA Bubble. What about Malika Andrews’ boyfriends and romantic relationships, though?</strong></p><p>Malika has drawn a lot of attention from sports fans all over the world due to her successful career in the sports industry. For the same reason, there are obvious concerns about her romantic and marital relationships. Does she, in fact, have a boyfriend? Learn more about her dating history in the following article.</p><h2><span id=Is_Malika_Andrews_dating_anyone_If_so_who_exactly_is_he>Is Malika Andrews dating anyone? If so, who exactly is he?</span></h2><p>According to media reports, NBA reporter Malika Andrews has a boyfriend. Malika, on the other hand, has rarely spoken about her personal life. In the podcast Laughter Permitted with Julie Foudy, she didn’t hesitate to reveal that she has a boyfriend.</p><p>She revealed in the podcast, while discussing New York City with the program host, that when the COVID pandemic began, she was living in New York with her boyfriend. She also stated that she had prepared a question to ask the NBA finals winner alongside her lover.</p><p>Even after mentioning her boyfriend, the ESPN reporter did not reveal his name or any other information about him. Instead, the podcast conversation focused on Malika’s professional life rather than her personal life. People do, however, make assumptions about her secret affair. In addition, here’s a rundown of her rumored boyfriends and dating history.</p><h2><span id=Is_Malika8217s_rumored_boyfriend_Dave_McMenamin_dating_her>Is Malika’s rumored boyfriend Dave McMenamin dating her?</span></h2><p>When Malika appeared alongside her NBA colleague Dave McMenamin in 2022, Twitter was flooded with surprise and curiosity. Speculations swirled that they were dating, and the news intensified when her pictures of wearing a ring on her wedding finger circulated on the online portal.</p><p>Tweep tweets about Andrews and McMenamin’s presumed relationship after sharing their photos in one frame. One of King Vicious’ Tweeps tweeted,</p><p><strong>The Hypocrisy Exists Dave McMenamin of ESPN and Malika Andrews have a mutually beneficial relationship. Why hasn’t @espn suspended one of them or made their business public like they did coach? #ImeUdoka Is it due to the fact that he is Mr. Clean? Stephen A Smith and Malika Andrews</strong></p><p>Similarly, other Tweeps’ tweets such as,</p><p><strong>Please tell me this isn’t real.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m not sure what’s more shocking… Chris Haynes’ evil twin saying wild shit, or Dave McMenimen having Malika Andrews.</strong></p><p><strong>and many more.</strong></p><p>However, neither Malika nor Dave have addressed the rumor about their relationship to date. We don’t know whether McMenamin is Andrews’ secret boyfriend in this case. The rumored couple was photographed together at the premiere of Colin In Black And White on Netflix in 2021.</p><h2><span id=Malika8217s_Other_Suspicious_Relationship>Malika’s Other Suspicious Relationship</span></h2><p>Malika’s name was linked to another sports professional, in addition to McMenamin. She was rumored to be dating ESPN’s sports analyst Richard Jefferson. Richard is a former American professional basketball player who retired from the game in 2018. Malika Andrews’ name was previously associated with Richard Jefferson.</p><p>However, without confirmation from the individuals, this matter faded away. According to our findings, the two are nothing more than coworkers.</p><h2><span id=Her_Relationship_History>Her Relationship History</span></h2><p>Aside from her rumored relationship, no information about her dating history has been made public. Malika, who has an estimated net worth of $800,000, has never revealed any information about her previous relationships.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>journalist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kylie Atwood</a></h3>Kylie Atwood estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
