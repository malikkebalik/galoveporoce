He is a rapper, an actor and a songwriter, who became famous using the stage name C-Murder, prophetic as it turned out. He is a member of the No Limit family, being the younger brother of <a href=#>Master P</a>, founder of No Limit Records.</p><p>So just how rich is C Murder? Sources estimate his net worth at $500,000, most of the money having been made in the music industry, from album sales, song writing and producing. He has released more than half of his albums from prison, where he is serving a life sentence for murder. In 2009, the jury found Corey Miller guilty for killing a 16-year old fan in a fight.</p><h3>C Murder Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Corey Miller grew up in a family with influence in the hip-hop industry. His brothers are <a href=#>Master P</a> and <a href=#>Silkk the Shocker</a>, and he is related to the rappers <a href=#>Romeo</a> and Mo B. Dick, and to actress Cymphonique. He launched his first hits on the No Limit compilations and, in 1998, he released his debut album, “Life or Death”, which reached number three on the Billboard 200. His first album went platinum quickly, selling over a million copies.</p><p>During his career, C-Murder has released eight albums and worked with various labels. After the first album, he released another three before going to prison – “Bossalinie” in 1999, “Trapped in Crime” in 2000, and “C-P-3.com” in 2001. His best known hit, “Down for My N’s”, featuring <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> and Magic, was also released in this successful period. Other famous singles assigned to C-Murder are “Gangsta Walk”, “Down 4 My Niggaz”, “Like a Jungle” and “Wobble Wobble”, released together with 504 Boyz.</p><p>Besides writing and performing, C-Murder started building an acting career. He appeared in his first support role in 1997 in the film “I’m Bout It”, followed by two other films, “MP da Last Don” and “I Got the Hook Up”. He also had appearances in two films produced by No Limit, “Da Game of Life”, released in 1998, and “Hot Boyz”, launched in 2000. In the same year, the rapper founded his own record label, TRU Records (Bossalinie Records), which added money to his net worth from several contracts with lesser known artists of the genre.</p><p>In 2003, C Murder was convicted for beating and shooting a teenage fan in a club in Louisiana. However, he obtained a special permit from the judge which allowed him to continue his music career and, in 2005, he released his first album from prison, “The Truest Shit I Ever Said”, followed by three more albums, the latest released in 2015.</p><p>In 2009, the jury reached a 10-2 verdict in Corey Miller’s murder case, and convicted him of second-degree murder, with a life sentence. Despite all efforts, C Murder and his lawyers haven’t succeeded in changing this decision.</p><p>Behind bars, C Murder has written several novels, including “Death Around the Corner” published in 2007, “Red Beans and Dirty Rice for the Soul” and “Bound by Loyalty”, both released in 2014.</p><p>In his personal life, C-Murder was married to Dionne Miller between 1999 and 2001.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.323529411765><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>9th March 1971</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New Orleans, Louisiana USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.92&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>American rapper, songwriter, actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Dionne Miller</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Siblings</td><td>Master P, Silkk the Shocker, Germaine Miller, Kevin Miller, Down for My N's, Y'all Heard of Me, Ghetto Ties</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Corey Miller, Corey "C-Murder" Miller</td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/iamcmurder</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0127358</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Albums</td><td>“The Truest Shit I Ever Said”, “Life or Death”, “Bossalinie”, “Trapped in Crime”, “C-P-3.com”</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>Undisputed, Hot Boyz, MP da Last Don, Da Game of Life, I Got the Hook-Up, I'm Bout It, C-Murder: The Movement, Straight from the Projects: C-Murder</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=14.538533834586><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.1086956521739><td>1</td><td>Uncle of <a href=#>Cymphonique Miller</a>, and <a href=#>Veno Miller</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>2</td><td>After a new trial, he was convicted of second degree murder on August 11, 2009.
