The pop star lost 100 pounds with just workouts and exercises. Adele started working out, she did weightlifting and strength training, to cope with her anxiety. Losing weight was not her primary goal when she started working out. And weight loss pills, diet, and any other methods had nothing to do with her slim body.</strong></p><p><strong>Adele</strong> is one of the most talented <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>singers</strong></a> of this generation. Her incredible vocals are what made her one of the world's most successful music artists. She has sold over 170 million records with just four studio albums, as of 2023. She is not just the bestselling female artist of the 21st century in the UK, but she has been named the bestselling artist of the 2010s decade in the US and worldwide as well.</p><p>Not only is Adele commercially successful but she is critically acclaimed as well. She has numerous accolades to her name including 15 Grammy Awards, 12 Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award. Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world in 2012, 2016, and 2022.</p><p>She's gifted in abundance and it's very rare that her vocals get overshadowed by anything else but when she came back on the public scene in 2019 with a new body, having gone through a significant weight loss journey ahead of the release of her fourth album, that did it. Fans started speculating about the methods she might have used to slim down. Did she take pills, what pills did she take, or did she diet? What size is she now? Was it Adele's weight loss pills, keto diet plan, or Sirtfood diet that changed her body? Read to find out!</p><p>You might also want to read the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a></strong> stories of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sunny Hostin</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ken Bruce</strong></a>.</p><h2>Adele's Weight Loss Pills: What Pills Did She Take? Or Did She Follow Keto Diet Plan or the Sirtfood Diet? Check Out Her Pictures from Then and Now!</h2><p><strong>Adele</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@adele</a>) shocked everyone with her incredible weight loss of about <strong>100 pounds</strong> when she made a comeback in the public scene in time for the release of her fourth album 30 after a long time in the fall of 2019. She debuted a new body that showed that she had undergone a massive transformation and that got all people talking. How did she lose all that weight? Is it pills? What pills did she take? Or did she follow some diet? Was it keto? What's her diet plan? What size is she now? Just what is her weight loss journey? What's her <a href=# rel=noopener>secret</a>?</p><p>Such questions continued to get raised and several speculations were also made as Adele continued to <a href=# rel=noopener>lose weight</a> over the holidays eventually worrying some people that she was getting too thin and looked unhealthy. But she made light of her weight loss during her stint hosting SNL when in her opening monologue, she joked that because of all the COVID restrictions and travel bans, she had to travel light and she could only bring half of her, and that was the half she chose.</p><p>But that was all she said. It was a long time before Adele actually addressed the questions about how she lost weight and whether it was the pills or <a href=# rel=noopener>diet</a>. So, rumors that she did take pills and did dieting ran rampant. The most widespread rumor was the one that said that the Hello hitmaker achieved all that weight loss success with the help of the <a href=# rel=noopener>sirtfood diet</a>. This was the diet plan she was also linked to after she <a href=# rel=noopener>lost weight in 2016</a>.</p><p>In January 2020, those rumors gained more traction when People reported that Adele had been following a 'strict' diet and other outlets picked up the story and began reporting that she was indeed following the Sirtfood diet. However, they were revealed to be untrue when the Grammy winner herself discredited those when she <a href=# rel=noopener>shut down the rumors</a> in an interview she did with British Vogue. "No, Ain't done that."</p><p>The popstar further clarified that she didn't try intermittent fasting or any particular diet for that matter. Instead, Adele had been eating more than ever, more than she used to because she had been working out so hard. She didn't mention anything about taking weight loss pills so, maybe it's all workout and nothing else that got her her new body. She said,</p><p><strong>If anything I eat more than I used to because I work out so hard. That whole thing of like, ‘Gets Revenge Body’ ... It’s ridiculous. I think it’s that people love to portray a divorced woman as spinning out of control.</strong></p><p>As she revealed to <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>, she isn't fussy about what she eats, and she loved to eat Chinese food and that her favorite order at McDonald's is chicken nuggets, a Big Mac, and fries. During her Adele, One Night Only TV special with Oprah, she finally told her weight loss story and gave a rare insight about the anxiety she had after she divorced <strong>Simon Konecki</strong> which ultimately led her to do exercise for relief. She said that exercises and workouts really contributed to her getting her mind right. And slimming down too. Weight loss pills had nothing to do with that.</p><p>The Easy on Me singer opened up about her exercise regimen in an interview with British Vogue. She went into detail about all the weightlifting and circuit training she had been working on for three years. Adele said that she worked out three times a day. She said,</p><p><strong>So I do my weights in the morning, then I normally hike or I box in the afternoon, and then I go and do my cardio at night.</strong></p><p>Adele worked with trainers like <strong>Greg Miele</strong> at Heart & Hustle gym in Los Angeles, California to get the most out of her sweat sessions. She also worked with <strong>Pete Geracimo</strong>, who does not promote <a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss pills</a>, supplements, powders, and potions. And she did make the most out of it. The weight loss of 100 pounds is no joke. But she didn't start out on her journey with a goal weight to reach in mind. For her, exercise (and just exercise, no pills as some crude remarks) was more about embracing a healthy lifestyle. As the 33-year-old singer told Vogue,</p><p><strong>It was because of my anxiety. Working out, I would just feel better. It was never about losing weight, it was always about becoming strong and giving myself as much time every day without my phone. I got quite addicted to it.</strong></p><p>Her trainer Miles also explained to Vogue that her aim was getting stronger, physically, and mentally. He said that she got really turned on to the movement and especially strength training that she started doing double sessions.</p><p>Adele revealed that she had also gotten into deadlifting during her conversation with Oprah. She said that she started with just ten pounds and slowly worked her way up to a majorly impressive 170 pounds which she had started lifting on the regular. The Rolling in The Deep singer also mentioned that she enjoyed boxing and that she's got a left hook that could kill you.</p><p>So, at the end, it's all just workouts and exercises and nothing else. There is no role of weight loss pills, no diet plans she followed, not even the Sirtfood diet that many outlets had claimed, in Adele's weight loss story.</p><p><strong>Also, a quick reminder for you to visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiYnZ2cmnq4scign61lnKTAtHnPoqOlq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-the-singer-lose-weight-was-it-pills-the-sirtfood-diet-plan-keto-or-other-method-the-sta.html&text=How%20Did%20The%20Singer%20Lose%20Weight%3f%20Was%20it%20Pills%2c%20the%20Sirtfood%20Diet%20Plan%2c%20Keto%2c%20or%20Other%20Method%3f%20The%20Sta&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-the-singer-lose-weight-was-it-pills-the-sirtfood-diet-plan-keto-or-other-method-the-sta.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-the-singer-lose-weight-was-it-pills-the-sirtfood-diet-plan-keto-or-other-method-the-sta.html&title=How%20Did%20The%20Singer%20Lose%20Weight%3f%20Was%20it%20Pills%2c%20the%20Sirtfood%20Diet%20Plan%2c%20Keto%2c%20or%20Other%20Method%3f%20The%20Sta" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-the-singer-lose-weight-was-it-pills-the-sirtfood-diet-plan-keto-or-other-method-the-sta.html&title=How%20Did%20The%20Singer%20Lose%20Weight%3f%20Was%20it%20Pills%2c%20the%20Sirtfood%20Diet%20Plan%2c%20Keto%2c%20or%20Other%20Method%3f%20The%20Sta" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-the-singer-lose-weight-was-it-pills-the-sirtfood-diet-plan-keto-or-other-method-the-sta.html&title=How%20Did%20The%20Singer%20Lose%20Weight%3f%20Was%20it%20Pills%2c%20the%20Sirtfood%20Diet%20Plan%2c%20Keto%2c%20or%20Other%20Method%3f%20The%20Sta" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-the-singer-lose-weight-was-it-pills-the-sirtfood-diet-plan-keto-or-other-method-the-sta.html&description=How%20Did%20The%20Singer%20Lose%20Weight%3f%20Was%20it%20Pills%2c%20the%20Sirtfood%20Diet%20Plan%2c%20Keto%2c%20or%20Other%20Method%3f%20The%20Sta" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-gwen-stefani-expecting-a-baby-girl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Gwen Stefani Expecting a Baby Girl!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./exclusive-premiere-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Exclusive Premiere  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
