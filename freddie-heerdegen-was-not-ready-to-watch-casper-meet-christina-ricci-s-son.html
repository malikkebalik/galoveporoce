Ultimately, the arrangement helps Freddie maintain a close relationship with both parents.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FREDDIE FOUND OUT HIS MOM WAS AN ACTRESS WHEN HE WAS 3</strong></p><p class=dh>Despite her fame and fortune, Ricci, a former child star actress, did not buy into sharing her celebrity status with her son at an early age.</p><p class=dh>She intended for him to have a typical childhood, but that did not last long. Soon, Freddie knew that his mother was a Hollywood icon. Ricci revealed that he was only 3½-year-old and a preschooler when he asked if she was famous. The long-time actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-son-freddie-casper-movie-1995/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He's come home from preschool and been out in the world and said to me, 'Mama, are you a movie actress?' And I didn't say that to him. People mention it to him."</p><p class=dh>Since her son was curious, she decided to show him, and Ricci confessed that he had watched some of her early features.</p><p class=dh>At first, Freddie was not interested in seeing his mom's younger version, but later, he became excited about the movies. So she showed him "Casper," the movie where Ricci's character befriends a ghost.</p><p class=dh>However, the actress noticed that it made Freddie overly curious and unable to distinguish reality from the onscreen pictures. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-son-freddie-casper-movie-1995/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He started asking me about my childhood with my best friend, the ghost. And we were like, 'Oh! Too soon.' For a while, he was asking me a lot about ghosts and living alone with my dad and being a ghost, and we were just like, 'Oh no!.'"</p><p class=dh>Despite Freddie's reaction as a little boy, his mother is open to him pursuing a career in acting if he ever becomes interested in it.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FREDDIE IS AN OLDER BROTHER</strong></p><p class=dh>Although Freddie's likes or dislikes are yet to make the news, he has one adorable title, big brother! The 8-year-old has a half-sister named Cleopatra Ricci Hampton, aka baby Cleo. The youngest member of the clan was born in December 2021.</p><p class=dh>Her parents are Ricci and Mark Hampton, the actress's second husband. Despite being a few years older, the "Casper" actress proudly announced her romance with Hampton last July.</p><p class=dh>A few weeks later, she said they would expect their first child. Despite having two kids, the actress has been hands-on in parenting.</p><p class=dh>In 2017, <a class="me a" href=#>Ricci</a> pledged allegiance to motherhood when she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/christina-ricci-gives-birth-to-2nd-child-1st-with-mark-hampton/>revealed</a> that "having a child forces you to grow up at the speed of light."
