She was able to overcome this painful position with the help of the community, despite the fact that she was clearly harmed, and there is no universal care or security in such cases. Nonetheless, Aiyana continues to work hard, making her detractors envious of her achievements.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Aiyana_Cristal_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Aiyana Cristal? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>According to credible sources, Aiyana’s net worth is over $700,000, and she makes a minimum of $70,000 as a sports reporter and anchor. Her position on CBS46 is secure, thus her entire net worth will only increase in the near future.</p><h2><span id=Aiyana_Cristal-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Aiyana Cristal- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Aiyana Cristal was born on March 22, 1984, in Tacoma, Washington, USA, to Caucasian parents. Her father’s identity is unknown, but her mother’s name is Benita, and Aiyana has a very close and loving relationship with her, and they still spend a lot of time together, not just for holidays and occasions. Benita recently encountered some major health issues related to lupus, which she has had her entire life; Aiyana was right behind her, supporting and assisting her in getting well. Aiyana is now spreading the word about lupus, improving community awareness of the disease’s impacts and consequences. There is no information available regarding Aiyana’s siblings.</p><h2><span id=Education_Detail>Education Detail</span></h2><p>Aiyana spent her childhood in Tacoma, completing elementary and high school education -managing to get an internship at Nascar as a high school junior – and after matriculating entered Georgia State University, graduating in 2005, obtaining a BA in Broadcast Journalism.</p><h2><span id=Aiyana_Cristal-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Aiyana Cristal- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>As for Aiyana’s personal life, no one can say whether she is single or has a boyfriend, as she hasn’t revealed any such information to the public, which probably means that she is single; she doesn’t have any children. One can suppose that she is focused on her job and wants to become successful in this sphere before splitting her strength and attention between family life and work.</p><h2><span id=Aiyana_Cristal-_Professional_Career>Aiyana Cristal- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Right after her graduation Aiyana started working, never missing a chance to show her skills and aspiration to work. In 2005 Aiyana was lucky to initiate her career at Fox Sports, where she worked as a production assistant. A couple of years later Aiyana moved to Champaign, Illinois after she had an offer to work in news for WICD News Channel 15, where she obtained the position of a news reporter. She enjoyed working there for more than two years, changing her employer in 2010, before deciding that she was interested in sports reporting and managed to get a job at KTHV in August 2010, working as a sports anchor and a reporter.</p><p>She left this position in September 2012, switching to WPLG in the same position of a sports reporter for 13 months, then changing her employer again. Later she worked for Comcast Sportsnet Chicago, holding similar positions of reporter and anchor from September 2013 to the end of 2015. Since January 2016 Aiyana Cristal has been working as an anchor and reporter at WGCL/CBS46.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_interests>Hobbies and interests</span></h2><p>Aiyana is a desperate dog lover – she has two dogs which she adopted from Atlanta Humane Society and Humane Society of Broward named Lilly and Whitaker. She enjoys spending her time with them, and always takes them for a walk with her.</p><p>As for her favorite hobbies and spare-time activities, Aiyana loves running trails and hiking – they are her true passions. Her mother Benita also supported Aiyana when she decided to finish a marathon track of five kilometers, cheering her daughter on. Aiyana also likes boxing, which she does as a part of her training in the gym.</p><p>She doesn’t abandon good food, even though she sticks to a healthy diet. She loves sushi, desserts, and pasta. As for her vacations, she enjoys spending days at the beach, swimming, sunbathing and running. She never stops training, even if she is on holiday.</p><p>Charity Aiyana participates in several charity projects, some more personal such as Lupus Foundation of America since her mother suffers from the problem, and has had serious health problems in recent years. Among other celebrities who raise awareness of lupus are Snoop Dogg, Lady Gaga, Paula Radcliffe, and Justin Bieber. Selena Gomez is also one of those celebrities who spread the word about the disease since she suffers from lupus herself.</p><p>Aiyana is also very active in promoting multiple pets rescue projects and organizations. She adopted both of her dogs and encourages other people to do so. As a reporter, Aiyana enjoyed highlighting a special program of the Town and Country Veterinary Clinic in Marietta, Georgia, which provides help to orthopedic surgeons and doctors donating their time and skills to dogs that would otherwise be euthanized.</p><h3><span id=Appearance>Appearance</span></h3><p>Aiyana has naturally curly long dark brown hair, and once shared an honest video in which she does her hair with a curler just on the scene of her reporting several minutes before she went live. She said she wanted to show that the world of TV news was not glamorous at all, and she had to do her hair all by herself on a windy if necessary.</p><p>She also once shared that when she was younger and only starting her career, her first news director made her cut her hair. Aiyana didn’t explain her feelings about the haircut, but she got a lot of compliments and supportive opinions from her followers to the comment and the photo. Aiyana has dark brown eyes and full lips. Her height is not available, though it is known that she weighs around 145lbs (66kgs). Her vital statistics are 41-27-39, and she has an hourglass figure which she always compliments with various dresses and skirts.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Aiyana is very active on her Twitter account which is read by more than 5,500 followers, sharing videos from her live shots and from the basketball NBA matches which she hosts for the Falcons. She is also very active on Instagram, posting pictures and videos to her account on daily basis, followed by almost 8,000 followers. Aiyana has a page on Facebook which has attracted more than 7,600 followers.</p><h3><span id=Cyberbullying_on_Twitter>Cyberbullying on Twitter</span></h3><p>In June 2015 Aiyana had a very unpleasant situation after her live hosting of a basketball match. The WSCR-AM 670 host Dan Bernstein, supported by Matt Spiegel, another host from the same channel, got so low that they started discussing Aiyana’s figure and claiming it was worth more attention than her reporting. They had that conversation on Twitter, making the whole discussion public. At the time of the conflict, Dan Bernstein had around 50,000 followers on his Twitter account. and Matt Spiegel almost 32,000, so the posts went viral at once, being seen by a very large audience.</p><p>Both Bernstein and Spiegel later apologized for their posts, admitting they behaved childlike and foolishly, but the conflict was not settled. Many people asked that Bernstein be fired for initiating the discussion, and some for his Twitter account to be permanently suspended. Several days later Aiyana answered all her colleagues, friends, and followers that she was very grateful for the love and support they showed her those hard days. She noticed that the world of television and especially sports television was full of misogyny and had a far way to go to get to a comfortable situation for every woman in the sphere.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a href=#>Avivasofia</a>, and <a href=#>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Lilchiipmunk</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Dan Merica</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVflra6rc2aZJyqmajBoriO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faiyana-cristal.html&text=Aiyana%20Cristal&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faiyana-cristal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faiyana-cristal.html&title=Aiyana%20Cristal" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faiyana-cristal.html&title=Aiyana%20Cristal" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faiyana-cristal.html&title=Aiyana%20Cristal" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faiyana-cristal.html&description=Aiyana%20Cristal" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ariane-davis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ariane Davis">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-angela-aguilar-s-boyfriend-confirmed-relationship-with-gussy-lau-photos-on-twitter-the-ta.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Angela Aguilars Boyfriend?
