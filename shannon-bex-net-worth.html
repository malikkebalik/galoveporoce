All of her endeavors have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Shannon Bex? As of early-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is over $1 million, mostly earned through a successful career in music which began in 2002. Danity Kane’s first album was released in 2006, and it was followed up by “Welcome to the Dollhouse” in 2008. As she continues her career it is expected that her wealth will increase.</p><h3>Shannon Bex Net Worth $1 million</h3><p>At a young age, Shannon was already dancing and started training in ballet – when she was seven years old, she danced as part of the Oregon Ballet Theatre in a production of “The Nutcracker”. Five years later, she went on to expand her dance skills, training in hip hop, jazz, modern, and lyrical dances. She attended Mountain View High School and was a part of the school’s choir, and drama and dance teams. After matriculating she would find work as a Portland Trail Blazers cheerleader, and would then venture into music as part of a cover band.</p><p>Bex stayed with the Portland Trail Blazers cheerleading squad for five seasons, and would then make an appearance in the series “Fame” in 2003; her net worth would start to increase at this point. She completed the show as a runner-up, and two years later became a part of “Making the Band 3”, becoming the oldest member of Danity Kane and the only married member of the group during its inception. The band would make several albums and projects before it was confirmed that their run had ended in 2009. According to <a href=#>Dawn Richard</a>, the band were all invited for another season of “Making the Band 3”, but only two people showed up. Shannon was very vocal about how the group dismissed two former bandmates D. Woods and Aubrey O’Day – eventually she was released from her contract with Bad Boy Records and considered possibly venturing into country music.</p><p>In 2011, Shannon formed a new band called Bex with several members of another group Elliot. One of their first performances was as part of the Magazine 2011 Artist Awards gala which featured major artists such as <a href=#>Beyonce</a> and <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a>. The group was short lived however, and disbanded before making any albums. The following year, Shannon decided to release a country solo album, and started a fundraising campaign to raise money as the album was going to be distributed independently. The funds helped her create the song “I’m Out” which would lead to her debut EP entitled “I’m A Woman”. In 2013, several members of Danity Kane reunited, though <a href=#>Aundrea Fimbres</a> would leave the group after a year. Bex’s continued endeavors would help with raising her net worth, but the reunion would only last until 2014 when an altercation between band members caused them to disband once again. Afterwards, Bex and another former member Aubrey O’Day would create the dance/pop duo called Dumblonde.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Shannon has been married to Ron Basada since 2003. Her older brother Marshall owns a video production company.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=7.7749196141479><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Shannon Bex</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 22, 1980</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Gresham, Oregon, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 3 in (1.62 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Model, Dancer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Mountain View High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Ron Basada</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Shannon Rae Bex</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/shannonbex</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/shannonbex</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38297872340426><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/shannon_bex/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/bexshannon</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1422850/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27118644067797><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shannon-mn0002092976</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Music Groups</td><td>Danity Kane, Dumblonde, Show Stopper, Damaged, Ride for You</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Making the Band 4, Fame</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=7.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Currently featured as a potential "band" member on MTV's Making the Band 3 Season 2.
