Sepsis kicked in. My blood was being poisoned by whatever the hell was leaking from inside my breasts and leg.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Following cosmetic surgery in Mexico, Rita Rodriguez said she was hours away from dying from sepsis. <span class=credit>courtesy of Rita Rodriguez</span></figure><p>She underwent surgery to remove the blood pocket causing the infection and was discharged after nearly a week.</p><p>Despite the CDC advising Americans to “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cancel any elective procedure</a> that involves an epidural injection of an anesthetic in <a href=#>Matamoros</a>,” some 1.2 million Americans still <a href=#>flock from the States to clinics</a> there and elsewhere in Mexico each year.</p><p>Business is so booming that there’s a transportation service to take patients from Brownsville to Matamoros via the BBL (Brazilian Butt Lift) Wagon: a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van illustrated on its side with a needle injecting a 6-foot-high cartoon butt.</p><p>Patients can<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> save 40 to 60%</a> over the cost of similar procedures in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>But some 200 US residents who recently underwent surgery in Mexico risked exposure to fungal meningitis, a potentially fatal infection.</p><p>So far, around two dozen have contracted it after receiving apparently tainted epidural anesthesia for elective cosmetic surgery; according to the CDC, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four people died</a> soon after as a result.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Shannyn Palmer sought a tummy tuck in Mexico. Due to a mishap during her procedure, she wound up severely burned and lost parts of two fingers. <span class=credit>Shannyn Palmer</span></figure><p>But even a simple nose job can go awry.</p><p>When Laura Avila, a realtor from Dallas, visited Mexico for a rhinoplasty in 2018, an anesthesia <a href=#>foul-up caused severe brain damage</a>.</p><p>She was taken to a Mexican hospital — and not allowed to leave for medical care in the US until the hospital bill was paid.</p><p>Weeks later, Avila died.</p><p>Kanisha Davis, a nurse in Long Beach, California, <a href=#>was left projectile vomiting</a> after a faulty liposuction/tummy-tuck in 2021.</p><p>But her friend, Keuana Weaver, died on the operating table.</p><p>When Shannyn Palmer traveled from Vancouver, Washington, to Tijuana for a tummy tuck last year, she<a href=#> lost parts of two fingers in the bargain</a>.</p><p>It was due to the inappropriate use of heated saline bags during the procedure.</p><p>“My boys thought I was turning into a zombie when my fingers were turning black [from the burn],” Palmer told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Dallas realtor, Laura Avila, was left with severe brain damage after a nose job in Mexico and died weeks later. <span class=credit>GoFundMe</span></figure><p>These problems from Mexico help to keep American surgeons busy.</p><p>“People come to this office every week for revisionist surgery,” Dr. Monica Wentworth, a plastic surgeon based in the border town of Brownsville, Texas, told The Post. “I see patients with breast implants that have been draining for several days. Pus comes out of the incision and the doctor in Mexico prescribes antibiotics instead of going in, removing the implant, washing the tissue and letting it heal.</p><p>“There is a lack of care.”</p><p>And when things go awry, getting them corrected sometimes becomes difficult, as doctors in the States can be reluctant to help Americans who got botched in Mexico.</p><p>MDs in Matamoros, meanwhile, can be dismissive.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Dr. Monica Wentworth, a plastic surgeon in the border city of Brownsville, Texas, sees more than her share of botched cosmetic surgeries done in Mexico. <span class=credit>courtesy of the Wentworth Institute of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</span></figure><p>“They’ll block your number if you bug them,” said Wentworth. “Cross the border for an elective procedure and you put yourself at grave risk. Don’t sacrifice your life because you want it [cosmetic procedures] at a lower cost.”</p><p>Justine Rodriguez, of Idaho, <a href=#>almost sacrificed her life</a> for bariatric surgery in Tijuana.</p><p>Discussing the complications, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she told Fox News Digital</a>, “My lungs collapsed. My kidneys and my liver were going. The infection went to my brain.”</p><p>In the recent case of patients who contracted fungal meningitis in Mexico, the infections can possibly be traced to shortages of the usual epidural medication.</p><p>Dr. Tom Chiller, who heads up the fungal diseases branch of the CDC, told NBC News: “There could be some bad actors in that space who are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">essentially operating sort of a black-market type of morphine business</a>.”</p><p>Beyond that, augmented breasts can be a game of roulette.</p><p>“Implant selection may be limited to what is available in Mexico instead of what patients desire,” said Wentworth. “For reasons that are never made clear, you may wind up with a DD cup when you decided on a C.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Before (left): a teacher’s botched tummy tuck from Mexico.

For my 31st&nbsp;high school reunion, I found a dress that went up to my neck. I’m angry. This [surgeon] ruined me. It is something I wish I had never done.”</p><p>A Texas healthcare professional, 45, admitted to The Post that she should have known better than to go south for surgery.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rita Rodriguez (left) had to wear a dress with a high neck to hide scars that came from plastic surgery in Mexico. <span class=credit>courtesy of Rita Rodriguez</span></figure><p>When complications — her breasts turned red, her temperature spiked, color drained from her face — arose after her surgery, she avoided discussing it with doctors she knew from work.</p><p>“I was embarrassed,” said the healthcare professional, who asked to withhold her name for career reasons. “They would have told me that I shouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>But a physician she worked with clocked her sallow skin color and insisted she go to the hospital.</p><p>Once there, a doctor made an incision in her breast. “Fluid that came out was brown — it was like chocolate milk,” the healthcare professional told The Post. “I knew I had an infection, but I didn’t know how bad it was. They removed the implants and I was on antibiotics for six weeks.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Justine Rodriguez went to Mexico for bariatric surgery and left with collapsed lungs. She was hospitalized and required a feeding tube. <span class=credit>Justine Rodriguez</span></figure><p>The root of the complication was as disturbing as the discharged fluid: “I had a bacterial infection. The doctor used dirty instruments,” she claimed. “It was the kind of bacteria that you find in feces.”</p><p>The woman’s sister, who went under the knife in Mexico at the same time, endured her own issues.</p><p>“She had dying tissue on her breast and it left a big scar,” the healthcare professional said. “That same week, a lady died while getting plastic surgery in Matamoros.”</p><p>She admitted that she and her sister were both drawn down there by the bargain prices.</p><p>“I was being quoted $16,000 [for breast implants in the US] and got them done for $3,500 in Mexico,” said the healthcare professional. “I had my breasts redone in San Antonio for $6,000. The experience was good. To people wanting to go to Mexico for plastic surgery, I advise saving up and getting the work done here.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Keuana Weaver died on a Tijuana operating table. <span class=credit>GoFundMe</span></figure><p>But the lure of vanity is so strong that at least one woman, a 42-year-old Texas teacher who normally avoids going to Matamoros even for dinner, steeled herself for a plastic surgery trip last year.</p><p>She signed on for liposuction and a tummy tuck —&nbsp;and got talked into letting the doctor inject stomach fat into her buttocks.</p><p>Waking up from anesthesia, the teacher said, “I felt like I had been hit by a dump truck. I thought that was part of the recovery.”</p><p>It got worse once she returned to the US.</p><p>“I threw up whenever I ate and my skin was gray. I saw a doctor friend and his nurse thought I was going to die,” recalled the teacher, who asked to withhold for reasons of privacy. ” I went to the ER. The first surgeon there didn’t want to work on me. They don’t want the liability of you dying on their table. He said, ‘We’re not going to touch you.’”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Palmer with her four-year-old daughter.

Dr. Wentworth scraped out a pocket of blood and completed the job.”</p><p>Scariest of all, the teacher found out that her butt injection could have been fatal.</p><p>“If they injected me two millimeters to the left, the fat would have gone into a vein that leads to my heart,” she claimed. “They should have never injected so close to that vein. It would have killed me instantly.”</p><p>Looking back, she said, “If I had to do this again, I would not do it in Mexico. After what I went through, I’m grateful to be alive.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mamxfnru0tcOeZK2glWK1qrPHZqmiq5tixLC%2By51kqJ5dorK5tcKoqmabmJqusXnCqKqmnaSesG6%2F1KuenqqpZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-the-high-risk-world-of-mexico-s-cheap-cosmetic-surgery.html&text=Inside%20the%20high-risk%20world%20of%20Mexico%27s%20cheap%20cosmetic%20surgery&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-the-high-risk-world-of-mexico-s-cheap-cosmetic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-high-risk-world-of-mexico-s-cheap-cosmetic-surgery.html&title=Inside%20the%20high-risk%20world%20of%20Mexico%27s%20cheap%20cosmetic%20surgery" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-the-high-risk-world-of-mexico-s-cheap-cosmetic-surgery.html&title=Inside%20the%20high-risk%20world%20of%20Mexico%27s%20cheap%20cosmetic%20surgery" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-high-risk-world-of-mexico-s-cheap-cosmetic-surgery.html&title=Inside%20the%20high-risk%20world%20of%20Mexico%27s%20cheap%20cosmetic%20surgery" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-the-high-risk-world-of-mexico-s-cheap-cosmetic-surgery.html&description=Inside%20the%20high-risk%20world%20of%20Mexico%27s%20cheap%20cosmetic%20surgery" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./s-thaman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="S.
