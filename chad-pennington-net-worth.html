Chad is a retired professional American Football player, best known to have played quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. He won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award twice, but all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Chad Pennington? As of late-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $25 million, mostly earned through success in professional football. He was the NFL’s all-time leader in career completion percentage, a record which was only surpassed in 2014. He helped his teams to numerous wins throughout his career, and all of these ensured the position of his wealth.</p><h3>Chad Pennington Net Worth $25 million</h3><p>Pennington started out playing basketball, but then switched to football during high school. He continued to play various sports including baseball, but decided to pursue a football career since it would lead to a better chance of getting to college. He entered a training camp at Marshall University and was given a scholarship there.</p><p>Chad would help the Thundering Herd’s run to a NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship game in 1995, where they lost t Monotana, but Pennington would help them chase after the championship again the following year. In 1997, he moved to the Division I-A, helping the school get their first bowl victory in the 1998 Motor City Bowl. During his senior year, the school went undefeated at 13-0 and won again at the 1999 Motor City Bowl. He set numerous records and also excelled at school, graduating with a degree in journalism.</p><p>Pennington joined the 2000 NFL Draft, and was the 18th overall pick by the New York Jets, becoming the first quarterback taken. He only made three appearances during his first two seasons, but was eventually given more playing time in 2002, helping the team to a 9-7 record and an AFC East division championship. He became well known throughout the league thanks to his performances, but suffered an injury during the pre-season game and it affected his performance in the next season. In 2004, he was given a seven-year contract extension worth $64.2 million, and would then bounce back to give the Jets a 5-0 record, however, he was injured again and struggled with his performances after his return. Despite that, the Jets were able to get a wild card berth and a win against the San Diego Chargers during the first round of the playoffs. They then lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers which had been performing well during the season.</p><p>In 2005, the injury struggles continued and after re-injuring his rotator cuff, he was expected to miss out the entire season. He had to restructure his contract to remain in the team, and worked his way back to become the starting quarterback of the 2006 season. He then showed top form and posted numerous career highs in the season. The Jets were able to make it to the wild card once again, but lost in the first round. He was awarded the Comeback Player of the Year Award thanks to his performance just one year after his injury. After a bad 2007 season riddled with injuries and lackluster performances, Pennington was released in favor of <a href=#>Brett Favre</a>.</p><p>In 2008, Chad signed a two-year deal with the Miami Dolphins worth $11.5 million, became the starting quarterback in the team, and would help the team win numerous games. They lost against the Baltimore Ravens in the first round but he was given another Comeback Player of the Year Award. In 2009, he injured the same shoulder and was placed on the IR with no assuredness of his recovery. The following year, he signed a one-year deal with the Dolphins and suffered a possible career-ending injury in that season. He attempted another comeback the following season, but tore his ACL which would then lead to his retirement announcement.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Pennington married college girlfriend Robin Hampton in 2001; they have three sons and reside in Woodford County, Kentucky.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.9576446280992><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chad Pennington</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 26, 1976</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Knoxville, Tennessee, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.91 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>104 kg</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>American football quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Marshall University, Webb School of Knoxville</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Robin Hampton</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Andrea Pennington</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Robin Hampton</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2075961/</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>William V.
