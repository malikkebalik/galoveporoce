To make sure that you are speaking with someone at the right time and not accidentally waking them up in the middle of the night, knowing the difference between East Coast time and Central Standard Time is essential.</p><h2><span id=What_is_CST>What is CST?</span></h2><p>Central Standard Time (CST) is the local time in the continental United States and Canada that consists of six large regions located in the central and most heavily populated areas. CST is the official time zone in the US Midwest, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and parts of Canada.</p><p>CST is also commonly known as America’s Central Time, as it is one hour ahead of Mountain Time and two hours behind Eastern Time. This time zone is most commonly used in the winter months, as during Daylight Savings Time in the US, the time zone is changed to Central Daylight Time, which is one hour ahead of CST.</p><h2><span id=What_is_EST>What is EST?</span></h2><p>Eastern Standard Time (EST) is the local time in most of the eastern United States and Canada, as well as some Caribbean nations. This time zone is mainly used in the winter months and is five hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).</p><p>EST is also commonly referred to as Eastern Time or America’s Eastern Time Zone and is used by over 18 million people in the US and Canada. During Daylight Savings Time in the US, the time zone is changed to Eastern Daylight Time, which is four hours behind Coordinated Universal Time.</p><h2><span id=Differences_Between_CST_and_EST>Differences Between CST and EST</span></h2><p>The primary difference between Central Standard Time and Eastern Standard Time is their times relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Central Standard Time is six hours behind Coordinated Universal Time, while Eastern Standard Time is five hours behind.</p><p>CST is also used in less populated areas of the US and Canada, while EST is used in the densely populated eastern half of the country and the Canadian province of Ontario. During Daylight Savings Time, EST changes to Eastern Daylight Time which is one hour ahead of CST.</p><h2><span id=Time_Zone_Centers>Time Zone Centers</span></h2><p>CST is centered around Chester, Illinois, while EST is centered around Miami, Florida. These two points are the reference points for each of the two time zones and can be updated in the event that an area switches from one to the other.</p><p>The distance between Chester and Miami is 810 miles, which is indicative of the fact that Eastern Standard Time is used in more densely populated areas of the region while Central Standard Time is more of a rural time zone.</p><h2><span id=Time_Conversions>Time Conversions</span></h2><p>When converting between East Coast Time and Central Standard Time, it is important to remember the hour time difference. CST is one hour behind Eastern Time, so when converting to EST it is important to add an hour. Conversely, when converting to CST it is important to subtract an hour.</p><p>When calculating Daylight Saving Time conversions, it is also important to remember the hour difference. EST is one hour ahead of CST during Daylight Savings Time, so when converting from EST to CST it is important to subtract an hour. On the other hand, for conversions from CST to EST, an hour should be added.</p><h2><span id=Points_of_Reference>Points of Reference</span></h2><p>When qualifying whether or not you are speaking in CST or in EST, it is important to consider what sort of location you are in and determine which time zone the area applies. EST is a much more densely populated area and is the primary time zone in the eastern US and Canada.</p><p>CST is a more rural and sparsely populated time zone and is used in the Midwestern and Western areas of the US as well as certain parts of Canada. Since the time zone differences are so often fluid and changing, it is important to regularly update your knowledge of which time zone which state, country, or geographical area is using.</p><h2><span id=History>History</span></h2><p>CST and EST have both been used since the 1800s, when railroads and telegraphs made it necessary for there to be some concept of a coordinated universal time for railroads and communication to function properly.</p><p>The two time zones were established in the late 1800s and, since then, have been subject to minor changes and modifications from state to state. However, the overall times and structure of the two time zones have remained largely unchanged since the late 1800s.</p><h2><span id=Geographical_Scope>Geographical Scope</span></h2><p>When considering CST and EST, it is important to note that CST is a much larger geographic region than EST. CST is typically used in the Midwest, Great Plains, and Western states of the US, as well as parts of Canada. EST, on the other hand, is fully comprised of the eastern half of the United States, Ontario, and much of the Caribbean.</p><p>It is important to remember that certain states may change their time zone from CST to EST depending on where they are located. It is also important to note that certain areas may observe Daylight Savings Time whereas others may not, which can lead to disparities between regions.</p><h2><span id=Significance>Significance</span></h2><p>CST and EST are two of the official time zones in the US, with both of them being based on UTC and dividing the North American region into two distinct regions.</p><p>CST and EST are important reference points for people working outside of their local area and planning trips or other events. Knowing the difference between the two is essential for any event planning or international travel and can also be a good conversation starter between people of different areas.</p><h2><span id=Summary>Summary</span></h2><p>CST and EST are two of the official time zones in the United States and Canada. While both are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), CST is six hours behind UTC and EST is five hours behind. CST is predominately used in the Midwest and Great Plains regions, while EST is used in the eastern portion of the US and Ontario, Canada. As with any time zone conversion, it is important to remember the one-hour difference between CST and EST.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCwyJ%2BdnqqVo7CmecGeq7CdlaN6pL%2FTZpinnF2awLV7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdifference-between-cst-and-est.html&text=Difference%20Between%20Cst%20And%20Est&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdifference-between-cst-and-est.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdifference-between-cst-and-est.html&title=Difference%20Between%20Cst%20And%20Est" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdifference-between-cst-and-est.html&title=Difference%20Between%20Cst%20And%20Est" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdifference-between-cst-and-est.html&title=Difference%20Between%20Cst%20And%20Est" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdifference-between-cst-and-est.html&description=Difference%20Between%20Cst%20And%20Est" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gal-gadot-stuns-in-one-piece-swimsuit-on-vacation-pics-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gal Gadot Stuns In One-Piece Swimsuit On Vacation: Pics  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./damon-wimbley-net-worth-pulptastic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Damon Wimbley Net Worth - Pulptastic">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
