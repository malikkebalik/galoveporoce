His Father, Robert, was a soccer player.</p><p>Robbie has a younger brother, born in 1985. His brother, Chris, is a former professional football player and is currently an assistant coach for Denver Broncos.</p><p>As a University student, he had led Lock Haven University to a Division II national championship. Moreover, he played professional soccer for St. Louis Steamers in the 1980s.</p><p>Growing up in Pennsylvania, Robbie joined Central Mountain High School. Apart from his studies, he became highly involved in extra-curricular activities. He displayed excellent athletic abilities in sports events, especially soccer, football, basketball, and track.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/robbie-Gould-with-His-Family-after-His-Brother-Chris-became-a-Superbowl-Champion-1024x1024.jpg><p>Highly inspired by his Father, Gould mainly took an interest in American soccer and played that game in his high school years.</p><p>But after transferring to Penn State University, he changed his mind and switched to football.</p><p>In addition, Robbie continued his studies and obtained a degree in Business Management from Penn State University.</p><h2>Robbie Gould | Career</h2><h3>College Career</h3><p>Robbie Gould enrolled at Penn State University in 2001. He did not initially have a concrete plan to make a career in sports. Robbie took up Business Management as a major and gave much time to his studies.</p><p>However, he was interested in soccer and played some matches. Gould soon became disenchanted with soccer and eventually switched to football.</p><p>The college football coaches did not trust him at first and provided him with a very little playtime.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Evan McPherson Bio: NFL, Bengals & Fiancee >>></strong></a></p><p>So, he requested his high school principal to send a letter of recommendation to Joe Paterno, the then-head football coach of Penn State Nittany Lions.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon the head coach invited him to play regularly for the Nittany Lions. But unfortunately, he did not have a great college career. He could only make 39 out of 61 field goals with a field goal percentage of 63.9.&nbsp;</p><p>He graduated in 2004 from college, and the next year, he declared for the NFL draft.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>As expected, he went undrafted in the 2005 NFL draft as he did not have good stats in his college year.</p><p>However, the New England Patriots signed Gould before the 2005 NFL preseason. Before they released him, he signed another contract with the Baltimore Ravens the same year.</p><p>Sadly, the club did not show much interest and released him three weeks later. After that, he took a break from football and began working for M&R Contracting in Pennsylvania before joining Chicago Bears for the NFL.&nbsp;</p><h4>Chicago Bears</h4><p>Robbie signed with Chicago Bears on October 8, 2005. He scored his first NFL goal a week later against the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>However, they lost the match. Much later, in Week 9, he scored his first game-winner against New Orleans Saints. He finished his first season with a 77% field goal percentage.</p><p>Robbie progressed drastically and performed very well in his second NFL season, scoring 26 consecutive field goals in his second season. With this, he broke Kevin Butler’s record for most field goals.</p><p>Moreover, he won many honors, and the NFL fans even voted him the NFL’s kicker for the 2007 Pro Bowl. The Associated Press named him to the 2006 All-Pro Team. Furthermore, he finished his 2007 season with a high goal attempts of 86.11%.</p><p>Following this, Robbie appeared in all games for the Chicago Bears in the NFL and always delivered well until 2011.</p><p>His stats kept improving over the years, and the mediocre performer in his college turned into the Bears’ most beloved player.</p><p>However, he suffered a calf injury in 2012 and had to rest for almost an entire year.</p><p>The following year, he returned to the game and scored the Bears’ longest field goal against the Cincinnati Bengals in the season’s first game. On December 13, he extended his contract for four years with the team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Robbie-Gould-in-Chicago-Bears-Jersey-1024x1024.jpg><p>Moreover, in the 2013 season, he became the second player in Chicago history to achieve 1000 points.</p><p>Robbie appeared in 12 games for the Bears in 2014 and scored 9 out of 12 field goal attempts. However, he had to rest following the quad injury.</p><p>He made a comeback for the team in 2015 and became the Bears’ all-time leading scorer with 1118 points.&nbsp;</p><h4>New York Giants</h4><p>After Chicago Bulls finally released him in 2016, he signed with the New York Giants on October 20. He scored his first field goal in a match against Los Angeles Rams on October 23.</p><p>He confronted his former team, Chicago Bears, on November 20 and even managed to score a 46-yard field goal.</p><p>Gould performed exceptionally well for the Giants and converted 10 out of 10 field-goal attempts into goals. However, the club waived him after the 2016 season.</p><h4>San Francisco 49ers</h4><p>Robbie Gould signed a two-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers for the 2017 NFL season.</p><p>He scored a 44-yard field goal in his debut against Carolina Panthers. Unfortunately, they conceded a shameful defeat. Nevertheless, he had a wonderful first season in his new club.</p><p>Gould even scored six field goals in a match against Tennessee Titans, making him the first 49ers player to achieve these many goals after 1996.</p><p>He continued his good performance in the 2018 season. Coming to the 2019 season, he wanted to leave the 49ers, but the club offered him a four-year contract extension worth $19 million, to which he agreed.</p><p>Moving on to the 2021 season, he suffered from a groin injury and rested for some time before returning to play on November 6.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;12 Best NFL Punters in the World Right Now >>></strong></a></p><p>After the team’s punter, Mitch Wisnowsky, got injured, he took over punting duty and did his best in that as well. Consequently, he was named NFC Special Teams Player of The Week.</p><h2>Age, Height & Weight</h2><p>As of <span>2023</span>, Robbie is <span>40</span>&nbsp;years of age. The Chicago Bears legend celebrates his birthday on December 6 every year.</p><p>Talking about his physical features, he stands at 1.83 m (6 feet) tall and weighs around 190 lb (86 kg). He has brown eyes and brown hair color. However, the player has started aging quite fast and has become bald these years.</p><p>Apart from this, he still has an athletic body and remains fit. However, he occasionally suffers from injuries too.</p><h2>Robbie Gould | Wife & Children</h2><p>Robbie Gould is married to Laure Cozzi. The duo first met in the early 2010s, and according to him, he liked Lauren from the moment he saw her in a bar in Chicago.</p><p>Lauren used to work as a waitress in that same bar. Robbie proposed to her during the Easter holidays in 2012, and the two eventually married on February 16, 2013.</p><p>In an interview, he remarked that he was crazy for her from the beginning and liked to take her on dates often. However, the jolly athlete added that he always searched for dating spots in the city during those years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Robbie-Gould-with-his-Wife-Lauren-and-His-Sons-1024x576.jpg><p>Presently, the couple is blessed with three sons, Griffin, Gavin, and Grayson.</p><p>He lives happily with his beautiful wife and three kids, mostly in Pennsylvania. However, his family frequently migrates as the player has to go to different cities because of his profession.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>In his long career of over a decade and a half, the experienced athlete has achieved numerous achievements and honors.</p><p>Some of his achievements are:</p><ul><li>Pro Bowl (2006)</li><li>First-team All-Pro (2006)</li><li>100 greatest Bears of All-Time</li><li>Second-team All-Pro (2017)</li><li>NFC Special Teams Player of The Month (December 2008)</li><li>Ed Block Courage Award (2016)</li></ul><h2>Net Worth, Salary & Career Earnings</h2><p>Gould has an estimated net worth of $22 million.</p><p>He mainly earns money through his league games.
