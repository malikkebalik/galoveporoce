The 1993-95 third strip, worn by brother Liam in the same photos, was in similar demand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Chapman says both remain among the sought-after City strips on the market, though the third shirt worn by Liam is more elusive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>1996-97 Away</b></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Strong contender for worst ever Man City away kit <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bsWboomI9M</a></p><p>— Definitely Maybe (@Def_Maybe_33) <a href=#>January 5, 2014</a></p><p><span>Even a peak-fame Noel Gallagher couldn’t make the last shirt of the iconic Brother-Umbro partnership look good.

However, due to the fact it used the exact same colors as the home shirt, it wasn’t worn too frequently. It did receive an airing for a goalless FA Cup match at West Ham in January 2008 (even though the home side also sported a similar shade of blue).
