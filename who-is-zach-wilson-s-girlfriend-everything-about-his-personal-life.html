He is the&nbsp;quarterback for the New York Jets (NYJ). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He was selected in the 2021 <a href=# rel=follow>National Football League</a> (NFL) Drafts’ second overall by the Jets. Before that, Wilson was signed to play college football for Brigham Young University (BYU).&nbsp;</p><p>Wilson is a very accomplished football player. He played football professionally since high school and has not stopped to date.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The quarterback has a strong support system. His family has been there for him throughout his journey. Similarly, he has a girlfriend who has been with him through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is everything you need to know about Wilson’s love life and family.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Zach Wilson Married?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>No, Wilson is not married. However, he is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, Abbey Gile.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The duo <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> when they were in high school. Wilson studied at Corner Canyon High School in Utah, whereas&nbsp;Gile attended Brighton High School. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even though they did not attend the same school, they knew each other. Their relationship began in 2017.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The first public picture Gile made of the duo was on Instagram. She posted a picture of the two on August 19, 2017. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gile is a dancer. Back in February 2019, she and her team won first place at a Utah dance contest.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple is highly supportive of each other. In 2017, Wilson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">missed</a> his last homecoming dance to see his girlfriend perform.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Similarly, as evident by Wilson’s Instagram, Gile is always present during his games and football events.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Zach Wilson’s Family</h2><p>Zach comes from a successful and hardworking <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">family</a>. His grandparents from his mother’s side of the family, Gary and Rose Neeleman have seven children. Those seven children have 36 children of their own and 28 grandchildren.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All of Zach's seven uncles and aunts, including his mother Lisa Wilson, are very accomplished. From lawyers and doctors to international bureau chiefs and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;The Neeleman family has it all.&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa is a personal trainer and has a business of sweatshirts and Tee-shirts. She has six children, out of which Zach is one of them.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>When he was young, the quarterback was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a trait that runs in the Neeleman family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zach is under medication for it.&nbsp;</p><p>While ADHD hampered Zach’s studies, it aided him in playing football. Mike Wilson, the athlete’s father, is the one who inspired Zach to play the sport.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike was a football player himself. He was a defensive lineman in school. He later signed with the Utah Utes and played from 1992 to 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike’s career in football ended after he had a severe knee injury. He underwent seven knee surgeries, which ended his dreams of being a football player.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, his&nbsp;legacy is now being carried by his son. Mike coached Zach’s little league football when Zach was young.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>In the upcoming years, he helped the quarterback with workouts, passes, and drills. In addition, the father-son duo watched and studied football films to help get Zach better.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Mike was also his son’s private quarterback coach. He knew nothing about playing quarterback since he was a defensive lineman.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, for&nbsp;his son, Mike watched and studied from other coaches and YouTube videos. He taught himself to coach quarterbacks from the footwork to throwing motions.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, Mike reviews his son’s performances. Even though they live states apart, the father-son duo talk on the phone daily.&nbsp;</p><p>Zach also sends his practice videos to his dad. Mike gives the quarterback pointers and advice to help his son be one of the best players the NFL has seen.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwxsCcn2avmaHAsLqMoKCrpJantqa6w2efraWc</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-zach-wilson-s-girlfriend-everything-about-his-personal-life.html&text=Who%20Is%20Zach%20Wilsons%20Girlfriend%3f%20Everything%20about%20His%20Personal%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-zach-wilson-s-girlfriend-everything-about-his-personal-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-zach-wilson-s-girlfriend-everything-about-his-personal-life.html&title=Who%20Is%20Zach%20Wilsons%20Girlfriend%3f%20Everything%20about%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-zach-wilson-s-girlfriend-everything-about-his-personal-life.html&title=Who%20Is%20Zach%20Wilsons%20Girlfriend%3f%20Everything%20about%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-zach-wilson-s-girlfriend-everything-about-his-personal-life.html&title=Who%20Is%20Zach%20Wilsons%20Girlfriend%3f%20Everything%20about%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-zach-wilson-s-girlfriend-everything-about-his-personal-life.html&description=Who%20Is%20Zach%20Wilsons%20Girlfriend%3f%20Everything%20about%20His%20Personal%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-look-at-the-relationship-between-dannella-lane-and-lil-rel-howery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Look At The Relationship Between Dannella Lane And Lil Rel Howery">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./up-and-down-doja-cat-lyrics-meaning-videos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Up and Down | Doja Cat Lyrics, Meaning &amp;amp; Videos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
