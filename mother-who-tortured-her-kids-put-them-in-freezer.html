It was during this process that they found the deep freezer in the living room, which held a horrifying secret.</p><p>Inside the freezer, the crew discovered the body of a teenage girl wrapped in a plastic bag, and underneath her was the body of a younger boy.</p><p>The police were immediately called, and they soon identified the bodies as Blair’s own children, Stephen Berry and Stoni Blair. The medical examiner later determined that the children had been dead for at least three years and ruled their deaths as homicides.</p><p>Upon arresting Mitchelle Blair, she reportedly proclaimed, “I’m sorry.” This would be the beginning of an investigation that would uncover the dark and <a href=# title="Henry McCabe Disturbing Voicemail And Tragic Death Explained" rel=noopener>disturbing truth behind the deaths</a> of Stephen and Stoni.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading jtoc-heading" id=the-trial-of-mitchelle-blair>The Trial of Mitchelle Blair</h2><p>Mitchelle Blair was arrested and brought to trial, where she confessed to the murders of her children, Stephen and Stoni. She claimed that she killed her “demons” because they were sexually abusing her youngest son, Matthew – an accusation that has never been substantiated.</p><p>In August 2012, Blair discovered her son Matthew simulating sexual activity with dolls. When she asked him why he was doing that and if anyone had done that to him, he revealed that his brother, Stephen, had abused him.</p><p>Blair then confronted Stephen, who also confessed to the abuse. In a fit of rage, she started punching and kicking him, eventually placing a garbage bag over his head until he lost consciousness.</p><p>Blair admitted to torturing Stephen by pouring scalding hot water on his genitals, causing his skin to peel off, and making him drink Windex. She also wrapped a belt around his neck, lifted him up, and asked him if he liked the feeling of being choked. Stephen lost consciousness once more and eventually died from the abuse.</p><p>Nine months later, Blair found out that her daughter Stoni was also sexually abusing Matthew. As a result, she began to starve Stoni and brutally beat her until she died in May 2013.</p><p>Blair initially wanted to turn herself into the police, but after Matthew told her he didn’t want her to go, she decided to put Stoni’s body in a plastic bag and stuff her in the deep freezer on top of Stephen’s body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/mythgyaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/freezer-bodies-detroit.webp><p>Throughout the trial, Blair showed no remorse for her actions.
