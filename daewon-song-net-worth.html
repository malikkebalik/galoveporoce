He is also recognized for being named the 2006 Skater of the Year.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Daewon Song is, as of mid-2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Daewon’s net worth is over $1.2 million, accumulated through his successful involvement in the sports industry as a professional skateboarder. Another source is coming from his involvement in the commercial art industry. Undoubtedly, his career will become grander, and so will his net worth in the forthcoming years.</p><h3>Daewon Song Net Worth $1.2 Million</h3><p>Daewon Song spent one part of his childhood in his hometown, as he moved frequently with his family; his parents were very troubled, and sometimes Daewon had to call the police. Daewon had to escape from this ugly reality somehow, so he started drawing and discovered that he is pretty good at it. He entered and managed to win a lot of prestigious drawing contests and awards. He wasn’t able to stay with his parents because of their constant fights, so he moved in with his brother and older sister to Gardena, California, where he attended 135th Street School. As his neighborhood was filled with skateboarders, under the influence of that, he started skateboarding and got his first skateboard at the age of 14. Soon, he was spotted by <a href=#>Rodney Mullen</a>, who invited him to join his company Tensor, as a professional skateboarder and that was the beginning of his career.</p><p>In no time, Daewon began competing, and getting noticed by important people in the sports industry, and was asked by a number of commercial art companies to appear in their videos about skateboarding, or products for skateboarders. In 1992, he signed a contract with World Industries, and they began sponsoring him. As a result of the collaboration, he joined many of their projects and productions, including “Love Child” during which he got a chance to train and compete at the most prestigious skate parks and competitions, some of which were filmed, which added a considerable amount to his net worth.</p><p>However, Daewon was seriously injured while filming for this company, so he stayed out of the business for a while, and as he lost contact with his old colleagues, he thought of leaving skateboarding for good. However, he realised that it was the only thing that he wanted to do in his life, so he returned in 1998 and formed his own company and the brand Matix Clothing. It consisted of several of his friends who were skateboarders and who all had their own lines of signature clothing which they were selling, so increasing his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>To speak further about his career, Daewon started collaborating with his colleague and mentor Mullen again, and together they established Almost Skateboards in 2003, which became one of the most successful companies in the US. He also appeared in a number of videos, interviews and other company’s productions, and most recently, he became sponsored by Adidas Footwear. His net worth is certainly rising.</p><p>Daewon has won several significant awards, including the Trasher magazine’s award Skater of the Year in 2006, and was named The Most Impactful Skateboarder by Berrics’ Populist Poll in 2014.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Daewon Song is married to Shumate W. Song, with whom he has a son. Their current residence is in Los Angeles, California. In free time, he enjoys fishing and sometimes is active on social media platforms.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=7.2759226713533><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Daewon Song</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 19, 1975</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Seoul, South Korea</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.68 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>163 lbs (73.9 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Skateboarder</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Shumate W.
