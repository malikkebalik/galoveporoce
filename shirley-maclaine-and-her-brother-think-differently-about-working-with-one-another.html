The actress, who has been active in the industry since the mid -1950s, has not stopped working even in her late 80s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But MacLaine is not the only one in her family who is considered Hollywood royalty. Her brother, Warren Beatty, too, is the same.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The siblings do not have the same approach to public life. And apparently, neither do they share similar views on working with one another in the industry. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is Shirley MacLaine’s Brother, Warren Beatty?</h2><p>Named after the legendary actress Shirley Temple, MacLaine was born on April 24, 1934, in Richmond, Virginia. Her parents were father Ira Owens Beaty, a psychology professor, and mother Kathlyn Corrine (nee Maclean), a drama teacher.</p><p>The couple, just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three years after</a> MacLaine's birth, welcomed Henry Warren Beaty on March 30, 1937. He changed his name to Warren Beatty after he entered Hollywood. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>MacLaine was an early bloomer in the industry. She started acting before she reached her senior year of high school. Her first attempts at acting came at Broadway in New York City. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Trained in ballet, which ignited her passion for performing, she returned to NYC after completing high school, becoming a part of dancing ensembles on Broadway shows.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Shirley MacLaine with her brother, Warren Beatty.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Beatty basically followed his sister's footsteps into the industry. He became interested in movies and shows when he was a mere child, and that interest gradually increased as he went to his MacLaine's shows with her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>MacLaine's memories of him include him always engaging in something artistic, even as a child. He used to read books or sing along to records.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Beatty began his career in show business as an actor in 1957, starring in an episode of Kraft Theatre. But, as his experience grew, so did his ambitions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He soon went into producing, directing, and even writing his own projects. As MacLaine recalled in his book,&nbsp;Warren Beatty: A Private Man, he loves total control of whatever it is he is doing, in front of the cameras and behind. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As of August 2022, Beatty has 33 credits as an actor, 13 as a producer, nine as a writer, and six as a producer, with a few others in the soundtrack department. He has, however, slowed down now, seemingly staying busy with his family. The last project he did came in 2016 —&nbsp;Rules Don't Apply —&nbsp;which he wrote, acted in, produced, and directed.</p><p>As for his sister, MacLaine is still going strong.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Shirley MacLaine Has Never Worked with Her Brother</h2><p>With careers spanning over 50 years, you would think two people as close as siblings are bound to work together sometime. However, MacLaine and Beatty have never done that, and it may be by design on her part.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Closer</a> in November 2016, she opined that she and her brother might not be the best duo working together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"Oh, I don’t think we’d be a good team," she told the magazine. The piece also mentioned they might never work together.</p><p>Beatty, though, had other thoughts. "[That’s] not a bad idea," he said of working with his sister while talking to CBS Sunday Morning (via Closer). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This does not, however, mean that things are sour between the two.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The brother-sister duo has always maintained the utmost support for one another, in front of the cameras and off it. A good example of this came in 2017 when Beatty was involved in an unfortunate incident at that year's Oscars.</p><p>The director was given an envelope with the wrong name when he was to announce the best picture award. And the horror that ensued when he announced the wrong name was difficult for everyone to bear.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After everything happened, Beatty was dealing with the fallout backstage. MacLaine <a href=# rel="follow noopener">called him immediately</a> after the show, but he did not pick up.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>So, she called his home and talked to his wife, Annette Bening. That was all she revealed.</p><p>"I’m concerned with how (Beatty)&nbsp;must have felt being so close to him. I’m three years older and I’m protective," she told USA Today just days after the Oscars. "We know how difficult it was for him, but it was also for me." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>MacLaine and Beatty might never grace the silver screen together, but they still appear together outside it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuYnr%2BtsdhmpJqbnJa2r7GMm6morJiav2%2B006aj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshirley-maclaine-and-her-brother-think-differently-about-working-with-one-another.html&text=Shirley%20MacLaine%20and%20Her%20Brother%20Think%20Differently%20about%20Working%20with%20One%20Another&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshirley-maclaine-and-her-brother-think-differently-about-working-with-one-another.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshirley-maclaine-and-her-brother-think-differently-about-working-with-one-another.html&title=Shirley%20MacLaine%20and%20Her%20Brother%20Think%20Differently%20about%20Working%20with%20One%20Another" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshirley-maclaine-and-her-brother-think-differently-about-working-with-one-another.html&title=Shirley%20MacLaine%20and%20Her%20Brother%20Think%20Differently%20about%20Working%20with%20One%20Another" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshirley-maclaine-and-her-brother-think-differently-about-working-with-one-another.html&title=Shirley%20MacLaine%20and%20Her%20Brother%20Think%20Differently%20about%20Working%20with%20One%20Another" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshirley-maclaine-and-her-brother-think-differently-about-working-with-one-another.html&description=Shirley%20MacLaine%20and%20Her%20Brother%20Think%20Differently%20about%20Working%20with%20One%20Another" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-dominant-center-2023-update.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Dominant Center [2023 Update]">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nhl-tyler-pitlick-brother-does-he-have-any-meet-cousins-rem-and-rhett-pitlick.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NHL Tyler Pitlick Brother: Does He Have Any?
