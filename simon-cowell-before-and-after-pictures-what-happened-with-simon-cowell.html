As the first episode of the new season of BGT aired tonight, fans were anxious to see Cowell. After a two-year break because of the pandemic, the ITV talent show came back on Saturday, April 16, 2022.</p><p>Simon’s new look was hard to miss when he joined<a href=# rel=noopener> Alesha Dixon</a>, Amanda Holden, and<a href=# rel=noopener> David Walliams</a> on the panel. Check out how Simon Cowell’s face changed after he got Botox.</p><p><a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>‘s choices about <a href=#>plastic surgery</a> are just as well known as his TV shows. After botched Botox procedures made him look like “something out of a horror movie,” the X Factor judge who is known for being tough has sworn to never get Botox again.</p><p><a href=#>Simon</a> said that there was a point in his surgery experience where he might have gone a little too far. He said that he saw an old picture of himself the other day and at first didn’t know it was him.</p><p>The TV star has said that he will stop using fillers because they made his face look terrible. <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> was on British’s Got Talent not too long ago. People couldn’t help but notice that he looked different. Fans of the ITV show went on Twitter to talk about Simon’s new look.</p><p>One fan wrote that he doesn’t know what happened to the judge and asked if his face was all right. “Simon looks like a Sharpei,” said someone else.</p><p>Another fan said that <a href=#>Simon</a> looks like he has fake eyelashes and went on to say that he looks like Dirk Bogarde did when he was younger in Death in Venice. Even though a lot of people liked Simon’s new look, others made fun of it. Someone wrote that you should watch Britain’s Got Talent and look at Simon Cowell if you want to be scared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/simon-cowell-1.jpg><p>Another person said that it’s too bad that Simon’s face looks like the Joker from Batman and that he used to be a good-looking guy but now he just looks weird. As was said, Simon admitted that he had fillers and that he had taken them out.</p><p>People were also surprised by how much the 62-year-old celebrity’s weight changed after he stopped eating certain things. No matter what the reason is, Simon Cowell has become a big deal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6i2rrvNZpqor5WhuW6uxJ%2Bmq51dlrulecCfq56qX2d%2FcYSVaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsimon-cowell-before-and-after-pictures-what-happened-with-simon-cowell.html&text=Simon%20Cowell%20Before%20And%20After%20Pictures%3a%20What%20Happened%20With%20Simon%20Cowell%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsimon-cowell-before-and-after-pictures-what-happened-with-simon-cowell.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsimon-cowell-before-and-after-pictures-what-happened-with-simon-cowell.html&title=Simon%20Cowell%20Before%20And%20After%20Pictures%3a%20What%20Happened%20With%20Simon%20Cowell%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsimon-cowell-before-and-after-pictures-what-happened-with-simon-cowell.html&title=Simon%20Cowell%20Before%20And%20After%20Pictures%3a%20What%20Happened%20With%20Simon%20Cowell%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsimon-cowell-before-and-after-pictures-what-happened-with-simon-cowell.html&title=Simon%20Cowell%20Before%20And%20After%20Pictures%3a%20What%20Happened%20With%20Simon%20Cowell%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsimon-cowell-before-and-after-pictures-what-happened-with-simon-cowell.html&description=Simon%20Cowell%20Before%20And%20After%20Pictures%3a%20What%20Happened%20With%20Simon%20Cowell%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-weston-jones.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Weston-Jones">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nia-riley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nia Riley">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
