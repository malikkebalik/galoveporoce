The show dramatizes its cast&nbsp;brewing illegal&nbsp;moonshine in&nbsp;the Appalachian region of United States while evading the authorities. In real life, authorities have not found any illegal evidence against the cast of the show.</p><h2>Who are the Moonshiners cast?</h2><p>Since the beginning of the first season, the TV show has brought several Moonshiners to public knowledge. While it is hard to track about <a href=# rel=noopener>all of the cast involved</a> in the show we have only included current cast member and some well-known names from the show; Jim Tom Hedrick, Tim Smith, Josh Owens, Chico and his wife Cassondra, Steven Ray Tickle.</p><h2>Jim Tom Hedrick and his net worth</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jim Tom</a> is so famous by his nickname that few people are familiar with his birth&nbsp;name.

He was born on December 25, 1940,&nbsp;currently making him 77 years of age.</p><p>Jim has over sixty years of experience in moonshining.
